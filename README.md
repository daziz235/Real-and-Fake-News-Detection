**Real and Fake news Detection
**
The project utilizes various data preprocessing steps, including text cleaning, tokenization, and vectorization, to prepare the news articles for analysis. Subsequently, a range of machine learning algorithms, such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Gradient Boosting, and Random Forest, are employed to train and evaluate models for real and fake news classification.
